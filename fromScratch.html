    <h1>My Future Adventure in Tanzania</h1>
    <img src="Mount-Kilimanjaro-Tanzania.webp" height="800" alt="Giraffe with Mount Kilimanjaro in the background"> 
    <p>As per usual, I've been craving another adventure. I've always wanted to go on a study abroad,and so this semester I decided to pick a program
        to apply to. Of all the options, the one that got me the most excited was the program titled: "Kilimanjaro: Adventure Travel in Tanzania."
        I thought the idea of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro was incredibly exciting, and so I decided to apply. Luckily, I was accepted!
        The program will count towards my minor in Tourism Studies. More importantly, however, the program will provide me with the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
    <p>The trip will look something like this:</p>    

    <ol>
        <li id="Climb">Climb Mount Kilimanjaro
            <ul>
                <li>The climb will take 8 days, because of how long it is, and how long it takes to acclimate to the altitude.</li>
                <li>Our group will have porters guiding us up the mountain, and we will be camping along the way! The route we are taking is known as one of the more scenic ways to the summit.</li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
        <li id="Learn">Spend two weeks learning at the College of African Wildlife Management
            <ul>
                <li>This is the "study" part of the study abroad.</li>
                <li>We will be learning from teacher's at this college, as we pick a topic related to conservation and tourism to study.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>  
        <li id="Safari">Go on safari
            <ul>
                <li>We will go on multiple safaris across multiple national parks in Tanzania.</li>
                <li>Exploring Tanzania's beautiful wildlife is the final part of this adventure, and I am so excited!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            
        </li>  
    </ol>
