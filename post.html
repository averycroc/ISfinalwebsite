                        <h2 class="section-heading">States I've Seen</h2>
                        <p>My family has always valued experiences. Much of my childhood was shaped by road trips and family adventures, and some of the most beautiful places I've visited have been in the United States! </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://selectregistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_12094555.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The Olympic Peninsula in Washington is possibly the most beautiful place I've visited in the United States. The hills were lush and green and full of wildflowers, and the mountain views were incredible.</p>
                        <p>Other than the Northwestern side of the United States, I've traveled to states in the west like California, Utah, and Arizona, and seen beautiful sights like the Grand Canyon, Arches National Park, and the Petrified Forest. I've made great memories in the lush hills and tiny towns in Alabama, and had so much fun exploring the wildlife reserves in Florida. Visiting the East Coast was magical; life is cute and cozy in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, where towns are full of apple orchards and cider mills.</p>
                        <p>Our country has so much to offer!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Countries I've Visited</h2>
                        <p>Although I love exploring within the United States, my dream has always been to travel outside the country. I finally got to do that when my family went to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico! We stayed at an eco-resort, which means every building and facility had been built into the jungle. We would see iguanas on the trees, turtles in the water, and monkeys right above us- all on our way to breakfast!</p>
                        <p>While Mexico was incredible, the real dream come true was living in Switzerland this past summer. After several years of friendship with a girl my age from Switzerland, my family was able to go visit and stay with her in her beautiful country. From ice-capped peaks, to wildflowers in every color, to the sound of cowbells echoing off mountain walls, Switzerland felt like a fairy land. Living with locals and immersing ourselves in their culture was equally rewarding, because we felt like we made lasting connections and meaningful memories in this beautiful place.</p>

                        <p>From Switzerland, my family was also able to spend a small amount of time in Italy, Austria, and Liechtenstein. Each of these countries were so uniquelly beautiful! Perhaps my favorite memory out of all of these adventures is swimming in Italy's Lake Como. The water was cool and clear and provided a beautiful view from all angles. I would go back in a heartbeat.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Places On My Bucket List</h2>
                        <p>The thing about travel is that it only leaves you wanting more. I cherish the memories I've made and the ways I've grown from my personal travel experiences. Because of this, more than anything,I want to continue traveling!</p>
                        <p>I have taken the idea of a bucket list quite literally, and composed an actual list of places I want to travel to within my lifetime.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.escapemonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/Northern-Lights-Iceland-Cover.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Alaska</li>
                                <ul>Of all of America's states, Alaska seems like the most foreign. It is such a distant and beautiful place, that it's intrigued me for years. If I could go there and see the Northern Lights, it would be a dream come true!</ul>
                            <li>Iceland</li>
                                <ul>Iceland has perhaps the most unique geography of any place on Earth. The country itself is a volcanic hotspot, so it is full of geothermal features. That, coupled with breathtaking beaches and incredible icebergs makes it a top priority on my list.</ul>
                            <li>Africa</li>
                                <ul>I want to go to Africa to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Luckily for me, I just got accepted into a study abroad to Tanzania, where I should be able to accomplish this goal! With enough training and determination, I should be able to check this off my bucket list this spring.</ul>
                            <li>Japan</li>
                                <ul>Last but not least, I hope to be able to travel to Japan one day. It is so differnt from the places I've been that it's daunting. But its beautiful geography is captivating, and I feel like I would learn so much by going that far across the globe.</ul>
                        </ol>
